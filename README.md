The objective of this game is to catch the falling eggs using the character (player) Chansey. For each egg caught, you gain 1 point to your total socre, and for each voltorb caught (pokemon that looks like a pokeball), you will lose one point from your score. We re-created this game based off the idea of the Pokemon Stadium 2 mini-game "Egg Emergency" for N64.
