The objective of this game is to catch as many falling eggs using the character (player) Chansey within the time limit of 30 seconds. For each egg caught, you gain 1 point to your total score, and for each voltorb caught (pokemon that looks like a pokeball), you will lose one point from your score. At the end of 30 seconds, the user will be prompted for their name, which will be written to and stored on .txt file in the working directory (File I/O). The previous scores will also be displayed at the end game. This .txt file is also stored on the server using sockets. We decided to use LibGDX for our application after seeing how much it would help for a program like ours (a game). We re-created this game based off the idea of the Pokemon Stadium 2 mini-game "Egg Emergency" for N64.
